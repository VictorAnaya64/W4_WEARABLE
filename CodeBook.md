# Week 5. Wearables DATA

This document contains the description of the script file "main source.R".

The source contains all the steps described in the assignment.

# The code

We start loading the data:

```{r carga, echo=FALSE}
Train_X<-read.table(file="UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt")
Train_Y<-read.table(file="UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt")
Train_Subject<-read.table(file="UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt")
Test_X<-read.table(file="UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt")
Test_Y<-read.table(file="UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt")
Test_Subject<-read.table(file="UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt")}

Feat<-read.table(file="UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt")

```


Then we assign a neme to the columns for  data set X, please note this is step 4 of the assignment, we keep descriptive variable names from the begining.

```{r Columns}

names(Train_X)<-Feat[,2]
names(Test_X)<-Feat[,2]
```
Add activity column
```{r Columns}
Train_X$act.labels<-Train_Y[,1]
Test_X$act.labels<-Test_Y[,1]
```
Add subject column
```{r Columns}
Train_X$subject<-Train_Subject[,1]
Test_X$subject<-Test_Subject[,1]

```
Add a column with the origin input source
```{r Columns}
Train_X$input.label<-rep("Train",length(Train_Y[,1]))
Test_X$input.label<-rep("Test",length(Test_Y[,1]))

```

Now we merge both data sets, this is the step 1 of assignment, and store the result in the variable Both_DSs

```{r merge}
## Merge training and the test sets to create one data set
## This is step 1 of the assignment
Both_DSs<-rbind(Train_X,Test_X)
```

After merging the data, we need to keep only the columns related to mean and standard deviation. also note we are selectig ID variables (souch as activity and subject). This is step 2 of assignment:

```{r subset}
## Select only colums that contains means and std
Vect_means<-grep("*mean*", names(Both_DSs))
Vect_SD<-grep("*std*", names(Both_DSs))
Select_Cols<-c(Vect_means,Vect_SD,562,563,564)

##Subset only columns with means and std
## This is step 2 of assignment
Both_DSs<-Both_DSs[,Select_Cols]
```

We can now assign labels to activities, this is step 3 of the assignment:

```{r subset}
## Assign descriptive labels to the activity columns
## This is step 3 of the assignment
Both_DSs$act.labels <- factor(Both_DSs$act.labels,
                              levels = c(1,2,3,4,5,6),
                              labels = c("WALKING", "WALKING_UPSTAIRS", "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS",
                                         "SITTING","STANDING","LAYING")) 
```


In order to compute easily the averages, we will build a "skin dataset", and group by activity and subject.

```{r subset}
#we will build a "skin dataset"
Skiny_DS<-melt(Both_DSs,id=c("act.labels","input.label","subject"), 
               measure.vars=names(Both_DSs)[1:79])

#Gruping dataset by activity, subject and variable
Skiny_DS<- group_by(Skiny_DS,act.labels,subject,variable)
```

We can get the mean value for each subject and activity, based on the groups defined in the dataset. this is step 5:
```{r subset}
#We can get the mean value for each subject and activity,
#based on the groups defined in the dataset
Step5_DS<-summarise(Skiny_DS,mean(value))
```
